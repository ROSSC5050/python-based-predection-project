# Stock Price Prediction and Fake/Real News Classification

This repository contains two separate projects implemented in Python: Stock Price Prediction and Fake/Real News Classification.

## Stock Price Prediction

The Stock Price Prediction project uses machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices. It employs historical stock price data and various features to make predictions about future price movements.

### Features

- Utilizes machine learning models such as LSTM, ARIMA, or other methods for stock price prediction.
- Incorporates historical price data, technical indicators, and potentially external factors.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/ROSSC5050/python-based-predection-project`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd stock-prediction`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the prediction script: `python predict.py`
5. Follow the prompts to input the required data and get the prediction results.

## Fake/Real News Classification

The Fake/Real News Classification project uses natural language processing techniques to classify news articles as fake or real based on their content. It employs machine learning algorithms to build a classification model.

### Features

- Implements natural language processing techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Uses machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models for classification.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/ROSSC5050/python-based-predection-project`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd news-classification`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the classification script: `python classify.py`
5. Provide the text input for classification and receive the prediction result.

## Data Analysis with Tableau: Loan Status

The Data Analysis project uses Tableau to analyze loan status data. It aims to provide insights into loan application approval rates, default rates, and other relevant metrics.

### Features

- Utilizes Tableau for data visualization and exploration.
- Provides interactive dashboards and visualizations for loan status analysis.

### Usage

1. Download and install Tableau Desktop from [Tableau's official website](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download).
2. Open Tableau Desktop and connect to the loan status dataset.
3. Use the provided Tableau workbook (`loan_status_analysis.twbx`) to explore and interact with the loan status visualizations.
